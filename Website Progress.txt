Marie Urmano: need to update bottom of the gallery for all webpages besides gallery, resources, and calendar pgs --> I(Monique) want to discuss this briefly with you to make sure we agree on what to put in these footers

need to create list of resources for resources.html

ANSWER:
who should manage the google calendar documenting all of WiCSE's events?
-- we should be able to link the calendar to Sara's, so whenever she updates her WiCSE President calendar the one on the site will be updated too

QUESTION:
is the sytle.css you added to the css folder for the slider on the gallery page? If so you should rename it to something like "slider_style.css" or "galleryslider_style.css" so that it's clear what the stylesheet is for and so we don't mix up the sytle sheets.

ANSWER: It is for the slider on the gallery. I was a little lazy when I added the style page, so I renamed it to galleryslider_style.css on the gallery html page.

have updated the gallery page with the correct style name- it is now galleryslider_style.css in the css folder +

-agreed that we need a list of resources for the site and that we should discuss what we want the footer to look like so it is consistent on all of the pages
